The Main.java file contains the main function, that tests our strategy classes.

There are two strategy classes:

1. MultipleMovieTypeFrequentRenterPointsStrategy
2. YoungAdultFrequentRenterPointsStrategy 

- The first customer demonstrates calculation of the frequent renter points 
  without meeting any of the above conditions. 
  
- The second customer demonstrates the use of the first condition, where he
  rents more than two different types of movies, and gets the double amount
  of frequent renter points computation for the first time after meeting 
  the condition.
  
- The third customer demonstrates the use of the second condition, where
  he rents more than one 'new release movie', and he gets the double frequent
  renter points computation for the first time after meeting the condition of
  renting one or more 'new release movies'.
  
This assignment also demonstrates the use of the strategy class. The output
can be found in the attached output.txt, and rest of the code can be found
in the src folder.
